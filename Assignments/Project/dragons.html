                I want to talk about morphs.
                It is important to distinguish the concepts of morphs and colors.
                Many mistakenly believe that the morph is, first and foremost, the color of bearded dragon. However, it is not.

                    According to the colors of beardies, you can study colors and shades.
                    They are gray, yellow, red, orange, white, and more.
                    Usually, for ages, owners of agamas call their pets Red, Gold, Orange, Fire-red, and so on.
                    But by and large, these colors are quite contingent and can change significantly with each molt.

                A morph is a more or less sharp deviation from the main species or subspecies, caused by a sharp change
                in the external conditions of existence, for example, substrate, food, etc. Or depending on internal
                reasons. The signs by which the morph differs from the main form are unstable: when the external
                conditions change, the morph often returns to its original state, inheriting its characters if only the
                external conditions are preserved.
